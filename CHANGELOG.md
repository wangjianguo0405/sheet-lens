# Changelog

**English** | [简体中文](CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md) | [日本語](CHANGELOG.ja.md)

One section per release. The section for the version being published becomes
both the release notes on GitHub and the notes the app shows when it offers the
update — so write it for whoever is being asked to install it, not for whoever
wrote the code.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-11

The interface now comes in English, Chinese and Japanese, and opens in your
system language. The button at the right of the toolbar switches it, and what
you pick is remembered.

- Simplified Chinese and Japanese throughout
- A language switcher in the toolbar
- The notes shown when an update is available are in that language too

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-11

- The update dialog now shows how far the download has got, instead of a line
  that only said "downloading".

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-11

First release: a portable Windows build of SheetLens that can update itself in
place. Unpack it anywhere and run `SheetLens.exe`; it keeps itself current from
the releases on this repository.

- Opens `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, `.xls`, `.xlsb` and `.ods`
- Sheets, search, go-to, column filters and a formula bar
- Cell, row/column and rectangular-block selection, with Ctrl+C in Excel's own
  format
- Ctrl+wheel zoom on Excel's own steps
- Excel-faithful layout: column widths, merges, borders, fills, fonts, the print
  area, and the shapes and pictures floating above the cells
